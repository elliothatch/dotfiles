# vimconfig
my .vimrc and plugins and anything else

setup
-----
after cloning run `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`  
copy `.vimrc` and `.vim` into your home directory  
or run `setup.sh` to automatically copy everything to your home directory (includes .gitconfig that has my personal info)
